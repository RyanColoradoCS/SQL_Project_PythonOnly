# Class Project for CSPB 3287 Fall 2023

For my class project, I am adapting the “Online Retail Application Database” idea from the Database Project Ideas to be a nonprofit online store that donates to charity.

For a simple background on how this would be implemented, my sister is an adult with disabilities, and I’ve always wanted to create a nonprofit store that sells merchandise and then donates all the proceeds to organizations that provide long time care to these adults and allow them to work and live better lives. This is extremely expensive and there just isn’t enough resources to go around, so this is my hypothetical online nonprofit to help fix this problem. This project will be the theoretical and pure SQL side of that implementation.

For my project, I propose to create a SQL database for a nonprofit online store that sells products where all proceeds go to charity to help adults with disabilities. This project will use hundreds of initial entries that will I create, and then I will simulate creating a new user that signs up, adds a bank account, and then purchases the most popular product on the site.

I used MySQL Workbench and JupyterLab for this project.
